# smallProcessingProjects
A place where I can store small Processing projects to work on and archive.

Each project will have its own Folder and README.md file, with a brief description of each project given here.

## Average_Colour
There are currently 2 versions of this project: the first contains all code within one file as it was written as a base for future re-factoring, the second performs the same functionality as the first, except it is Object-Oriented and is designed to build upon the ideas of the first version.

Average_Colour is a project designed with two main functions:
  1) Find the Mean Colour of an entire Image
  2) Find the Mean Colour of a selected area within an Image

Average_Colour is also designed to show the mean average as well as any other ancillary information to the user.
